Phrasebook was originally developed as part of the final project for the ***Personal Data Interaction for Mobile and Wearables*** course run at Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen. Original source code of the application along with other course material can still be found in the official [course repository](https://github.com/rickystream94/personal_data_interaction). The current repo has been created to allow further development of the application and continuous integration.

# Privacy Policy

> **Effective Date:** February 18, 2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how _Phrasebook - My Vocabulary Booster_ ("App") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information. This policy applies only to information collected within the App and does not cover information collected by any other company or organization.

## Information We Collect

* **No personal information:** The App does not collect any personal information about you such as name, email address, location or IP address.
* **Local Data:** The App may collect and store data you provide within the app itself. This data is saved locally on your device and includes:
  * All data associated to the phrasebooks you own (phrases stored, challenges history).
  * The badges you unlock.
  * User preferences (i.e. the file name of the profile picture you choose).
  * User XP points gained.

## Use of Information

* **Local Use Only:** The data you store in the app is never shared with any third party nor stored in any external server.
* **Backup:** With your permission, the App may save a backup of your local data to your device's external storage. This backup allows you to recover your data if you reinstall the App.

## External Storage Permission

The App requires access to your device's external storage only for the purpose of creating a backup of your local data. You can choose to deny this permission, but the backup functionality will be unavailable.

## Control Over Your Data

You have full control over the data stored within the App. You can access, modify, or delete your data at any time through the App settings. When you uninstall the App, all data is automatically deleted without the possibility of recovery.

## Third-Party Services

* **No Third-Party Sharing:** the App does not share any user data with any third-party companies or services.

## Security

Your data is stored in a `SQLite` database locally on your device. Android stores the database in the app's private folder. Your data is protected because this folder is not accessible by default to other apps or the device user.
However, since no additional measurements are taken to ensure your data is 100% safe, I strongly encourage to avoid storing any personal or sensitive information in the app.
For more information please refer to the official [Android documentation on `SQLite`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be effective immediately.
